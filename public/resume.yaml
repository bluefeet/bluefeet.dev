    summary: |-
      I had a long and broad ranging career at ZipRecruiter, from DevOps and cloud infrastructure engineering to product development. Over the years I mentored junior engineers, was a release manager, wrote documentation and functional specifications, gathered requirements and communicated changes. I introduced automated builds, tooling to increase visibility into our systems, and helped the company migrate away from a monolithic code base to microservices.

      When I first joined ZipRecruiter, which was then a small startup, I promptly optimized the codebase and revamped processes to improve release reliability and production environment stability. In the first half of my tenure, my focus was on boosting developer productivity by introducing essential processes and tools that facilitated company growth.

      In the latter half of my tenure, my role evolved to encompass active collaboration with product teams, engaging in an agile workflow that included sprints, retrospectives, and daily stand-up meetings. I worked closely with product managers and stakeholders to complete high-impact projects on strict deadlines.

      -  Improved the codebase by replacing complicated sections of code with simpler, more straightforward solutions which were easier to maintain, more flexible, well documented, and had increased test coverage.
      - Created a development database replication system using filesystem snapshots and cross-region replication, enabling instant access to destructible production datasets.
      - Introduced Grafana, continuous integration, Slack, reusable test data fixtures, enumerable other tools.
      - Actively advocated for test coverage, documentation, and high-quality code.
