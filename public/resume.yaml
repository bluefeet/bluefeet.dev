    relationship: Mike and Aran both worked at Rent.com, ZipRecruiter, and GoGuardian in various roles
    message: It is difficult to overstate the impact that [Aran] has made at the two companies where I’ve been grateful to be his colleague. As a mentor, he has had the largest impact on my career journey of any engineer I’ve ever worked with.
  - author: Alain Avakian
    relationship: Alain was the CTO of Rent.com and directly managed Aran
    message: |-
      I have worked with countless engineers, usually of very high caliber, but engineers of Aran's talents are far and few in between. I have had the privilege of working with Aran for almost three years now, and grew to rely on his instincts, and technical depth.

      Aran is the kind of engineer who can build a startup from the ground up, efficiently, fast, with a good solid architecture and a keen sense of the big picture, and yet he is also able to deep dive and solve very elusive technical issues, or find good opportunities for optimization, often while reviewing others' code.

      Aran has a very positive attitude, one that is calming and infectious, and a strong sense that he can accomplish anything. That, in turn, builds confidence in the team he is leading, motivating them while getting them excited about whatever project he is leading.

      It has been a true pleasure watching Aran mentor other engineers, and come up with tools / ideas, completely of his own initiative to drive efficiency and better collaboration.

      Aran will always be on my short-list of top engineers I would not hesitate to work with again.

      Working with Aran was a complete joy. He maintained a high level of focus on both the quality of his code and the overall quality of the product he was delivering to our customers. I served as the product manager for Aran’s teams over numerous projects spanning almost four years. I was always amazed by his empathy and kindness on a personal level and the dedication to awesome work on a professional level. His heart and mind are always in the right place.

      If there was a Perl Coders Hall of Fame, this man would get in on the first ballot. I would love the opportunity to work with Aran again. Any team that can count [Aran] as one of its members is truly made better for it.

    relationship: Demian was a senior software engineer at ValueClick and worked directly with Aran
    message: In the five years that Aran and I worked together, he has consistently proven himself as an awesome resource for complex issues. His ability to get to the heart of an issue quickly and offer valuable insight and opinions has helped reduce development time on many projects. This combined with his willingness and patience to educate and grow with his peers makes him a valuable addition on any project he joins.

    message: |-
      Aran is a rare breed in the world of technical managers. He is extremely technically competent, and could easily do the work of any of his reports. His highly commendable development/architecture skills are nicely complemented by his patient, affable, and approachable demeanor. This combination of technical adeptness and people-oriented personality is what is difficult to find in this profession, and what makes working for Aran a true pleasure.

      I consider myself fortunate to have worked for Aran. He taught me much about Perl specifically and Software Development in general. More importantly, though, the example of his leadership helped me to better do my job as an applicaton developer, and later as a project lead. I would not hesitate to recommend Aran for any position having to do with Perl - manager, architect or otherwise; and I would gladly welcome the opportunity to work with him in the future.
