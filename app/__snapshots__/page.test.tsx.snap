            I had a long and broad ranging career at ZipRecruiter, from DevOps and cloud infrastructure engineering to product development. Over the years I mentored junior engineers, was a release manager, wrote documentation and functional specifications, gathered requirements and communicated changes. I introduced automated builds, tooling to increase visibility into our systems, and helped the company migrate away from a monolithic code base to microservices.

When I first joined ZipRecruiter, which was then a small startup, I promptly optimized the codebase and revamped processes to improve release reliability and production environment stability. In the first half of my tenure, my focus was on boosting developer productivity by introducing essential processes and tools that facilitated company growth.

In the latter half of my tenure, my role evolved to encompass active collaboration with product teams, engaging in an agile workflow that included sprints, retrospectives, and daily stand-up meetings. I worked closely with product managers and stakeholders to complete high-impact projects on strict deadlines.

                  I have worked with countless engineers, usually of very high caliber, but engineers of Aran's talents are far and few in between. I have had the privilege of working with Aran for almost three years now, and grew to rely on his instincts, and technical depth.

Aran is the kind of engineer who can build a startup from the ground up, efficiently, fast, with a good solid architecture and a keen sense of the big picture, and yet he is also able to deep dive and solve very elusive technical issues, or find good opportunities for optimization, often while reviewing others' code.

Aran has a very positive attitude, one that is calming and infectious, and a strong sense that he can accomplish anything. That, in turn, builds confidence in the team he is leading, motivating them while getting them excited about whatever project he is leading.

It has been a true pleasure watching Aran mentor other engineers, and come up with tools / ideas, completely of his own initiative to drive efficiency and better collaboration.

Aran will always be on my short-list of top engineers I would not hesitate to work with again.

He provided the perfect amount of guidance, support, and mentoring I needed to come up to speed quickly on a large codebase. He's a spectacular programmer, a thoughtful manager, a kind person, and an unbeatable addition to any team.

                  Working with Aran was a complete joy. He maintained a high level of focus on both the quality of his code and the overall quality of the product he was delivering to our customers. I served as the product manager for Aran’s teams over numerous projects spanning almost four years. I was always amazed by his empathy and kindness on a personal level and the dedication to awesome work on a professional level. His heart and mind are always in the right place.

If there was a Perl Coders Hall of Fame, this man would get in on the first ballot. I would love the opportunity to work with Aran again. Any team that can count [Aran] as one of its members is truly made better for it.

                  In the five years that Aran and I worked together, he has consistently proven himself as an awesome resource for complex issues. His ability to get to the heart of an issue quickly and offer valuable insight and opinions has helped reduce development time on many projects. This combined with his willingness and patience to educate and grow with his peers makes him a valuable addition on any project he joins.

                  Aran is a rare breed in the world of technical managers. He is extremely technically competent, and could easily do the work of any of his reports. His highly commendable development/architecture skills are nicely complemented by his patient, affable, and approachable demeanor. This combination of technical adeptness and people-oriented personality is what is difficult to find in this profession, and what makes working for Aran a true pleasure.

I consider myself fortunate to have worked for Aran. He taught me much about Perl specifically and Software Development in general. More importantly, though, the example of his leadership helped me to better do my job as an applicaton developer, and later as a project lead. I would not hesitate to recommend Aran for any position having to do with Perl - manager, architect or otherwise; and I would gladly welcome the opportunity to work with him in the future.

                  Aran is smart, considerate, productive and a quick study. He was a pleasure to work with. He was very supportive of both his department members, marketing, distributions and other departments while employed at Thinkstock. Highly recommended.

                  I have never met an individual as talented as [Aran]. Working with him professionally over the years I have to say I admire his natural ability combined with his work ethic. Aran knows what he is talking about and knows how to communicate it. He possesses over ten years of experience as a web developer and is one of the best in the world.
